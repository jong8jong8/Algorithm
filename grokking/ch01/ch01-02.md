### 1.2 Binary search

```python
# simple search

def simple_search(arr, item):
    for i in range(0, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == item:
            return i
    return None

my_arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(simple_search(my_arr, 5))
```


```python
# binary search

def binary_search(arr, item):
    # assume arr is already sorted
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2  # int( (low + high) / 2 )
        guess = arr[mid]
        if  guess == item:
            return mid
        if guess > item:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return None


my_arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] # the sorted list (in the increasing order)

print(binary_search(my_arr, 3))
print(binary_search(my_arr, -1))
```


```python
# run-time measurement

import time

start_time = time.time()  # time.time_ns() for nano-second (10^-9 second)

# some code block you want to measure
# some code block you want to measure
# some code block you want to measure
# some code block you want to measure

end_time = time.time()

print(f"The run-time is {end_time - start_time} seconds")
