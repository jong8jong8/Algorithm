### 6.4 Implementing the graph



- 👉 Read "Grokking Algorithms"



- 🐍 `python` practice

```python
# Graph (using Hash table)

graph = {}
graph[“you”] = [“alice”, “bob”, “claire”]
graph[“bob”] = [“anuj”, “peggy”]
graph[“alice”] = [“peggy”]
graph[“claire”] = [“thom”, “jonny”]
graph[“anuj”] = []
graph[“peggy”] = []
graph[“thom”] = []
graph[“jonny”] = []

# test graph
print(graph)
```
